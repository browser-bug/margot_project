\section{Knowledge configuration file}
\label{sec:knowledge}


The configuration file that describes the application knowledge must be a different file with respect to the one that describes extra-functional concerns, to ensure separation of concerns.
The structure of the configuration file matches the application knowledge representation of mARGOt.
In particular, it is a list of Operating Points (OPs), where each OP has up to three fields:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The feature section (if any)
	\item The software-knobs section
	\item The metric section
\end{enumerate}
The feature section states the value for each input feature field.
Since mARGOt use input features as indipedent cluster of Operating Point, a best practice would be to ensure that all the input feature clusters contain OPs with the same configurations of software-knobs.

Each section of the OP is basically a key-value pair, where the key is the name of field and the value is a number, which represents its average value.
In the software-knob section, the field can be a string.
In the metric section, we can use two values to define the mean and standard deviation of the related distribution.
These two exceptions are enabled by the the extra-functional concerns stated in the mARGOt configuration file, explained in details in \prettyref{sec:adaptation}.

}

\prettyref{code:knowledge_file} shows an example of the syntax of the knowledge file, that defines an Operating Point list for a block named ``foo'', by defining a root element with the same name that will contain the OP list.
A configuration file that represents the application knowledge may contain more than one OP list, if the application is composed of more than one block of code.
However, this behaviour is not recommended to ensure separation of concerns.
The application knowledge of a block of code can be splitted in more than file, to limit its size.
In this example, we have just a single input feature named ``resolution'', defined in the element with tag \textbf{features}.
If we don't have any input feature, the \textbf{features} element can be omitted.
We have two software-knobs, named ``threads'' and ``algorithm'', defined in the element with tag \textbf{knobs}.
The values of the second knob are strings.
Finally, we have two metrics, named ``throughput'' and ``quality'', defined in the element with tag \textbf{metrics}.
For the metric ``quality'', the average value is enough to describe the reached performance.
It may happen when the metric is determistic.
Instead, the metric ``throughput'' is a distribution defined by an average value and the standard deviation.
While the OPs that belong to the same block managed by mARGOt have the same structure, the actual values changes to define the application knowledge.
