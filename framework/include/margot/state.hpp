   * @brief This class represents a constrained multi-objective optimization problem
   *
   * @tparam OperatingPoint The type which defines the Operating Point characteristics
   * @tparam priority_type The type used to represents the priority of a constraint
   * @tparam error_coef_type The type used to compute the error coefficient of the application knowledge
   *
   * @details
   * This class is the core of the mARGOt framework since it aims at solving the optimization problem,
   * which is formulated as follows:
   *
   *         minimize/minimize f(OperatingPoint)
   *
   *           s.t.     c1(OperatingPoint) ยง goal1
   *                    c2(OperatingPoint) ยง goal2
   *                          ...            ...
   *
   * Where f(OperatingPoint) represents the objective funcion to maxime or minimize, cn extracts a numeric
   * value from an Operating Point and goaln is the goal to achieve to satisfy the n-th constraint.
   * This class provides all the required methods to alter the formulation of the problem, to alter the
   * application knowledge, to take into account runtime information and to solve it.
   *
   * From the implementation points of ciew, a state uses constraints to filter all the Operating Point in
   * the application knowledge. In particular, each constraint keeps track internally of all the Operating
   * Point valid for higher priority constraints, but not valid for the considered constraint.
   * If an Operating Point is valid for all the constraints, it is inserted in the rank container, which
   * evaluate all the valid Operating Point according to the objective function.
   *
   * This class has two main task: keep a consistent representation of the problem and select the most
   * suitable configuration in an efficient way.
