\section{Conclusion}

This document describes mARGOt, a dynamic autotuner framework, from an high-level point of view.
Moreover, it provides examples on how it is possible to enhance an application with an adaptation layer.
For a complete reference on the implementation details, please refer to the Doxygen documentation.

To further simplify the integration process, mARGOt ships with an utility tool, named \textit{margot\_cli}, which provides to the application developer additional features to ease the integration process.
In particular, it can generate an high level interface, named \textit{margot heel}, that hides as much as possible implementation details.
The guide to the utility is covered in a separate user guide.
