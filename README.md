# README
This repository contains the mARGOt framework core, version 2

## Summary of the framework

The mARGOt framework core provides to an application the ability to dynamically adapt, in order to face changes in the execution environment or in the application requirements. The framework exploits the information gathered during a Design Space Exploration in order to guide the selection of the most suitable configuration of the application software knobs. The application may define a set constraints on its performance and a rank function that expresses how good is an Operating Point for the application. At Run-Time the framework senses the execution environments, by means of run-time monitors, and automatically selects the best configuration that fit the observed situation.
